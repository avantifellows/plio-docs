# Plio for Teams

Plio has been built to support teams. We provide a separate workspace for teams to collaborate with each other effectively. Look at the video below for an overview:

We provide the following support for organizations:
-  An organizational workspace to house all the plios created by the organization members.
-  Members of a workspace can view/edit/analyse the plios created by other members.
-  [Integration with BigQuery](#data-analysis-using-bigquery) to enable you to build custom dashboards.
-  [Single Sign-On (SSO)](#single-sign-on-sso) in case you want your viewers to bypass Plio's authentication layer.
-  [Mapping data to users](#mapping-data-to-users) if you want to know the true identities of your users in the downloaded report for each Plio.
