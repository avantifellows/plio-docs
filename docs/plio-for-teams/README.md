# Plio for Teams

Plio has been built to support teams. We provide a separate workspace for teams to collaborate with each other effectively. Look at the video below for an overview:

We provide the following support for organizations:
-  an organizational workspace which has all the plios created by its members within that workspace
-  members of a workspace can view/edit/analyse the plios created by other members
-  [integration with BigQuery](#data-analysis-using-bigquery) to enable you to build custom dashboards
-  custom authentication in case you want your viewers to bypass Plio's authentication layer
